                <p>A community's shared understanding of a problem and how to address it is essential for effective action, including a common recognition of the issue and its causes, a shared vision of possible solutions, a collective sense of ownership over decisions, and a united commitment to follow through.</p>
                
                <p>While outside ideas can inspire action, it is ultimately the community's collective experience, decision-making, manpower, and financial resources that drive meaningful progress.</p>

                <p>Apo Islanders reversed the collapse of their coral reef and fisheries by creating a marine sanctuary on 10% of their fishing grounds and establishing community management across the entire area.</p>
                
                <p>Drawing on traditional decision-making practices, representatives from all island families assembled to discuss the crisis until reaching consensus, even if it took days. The community established clear rules on destructive fishing practices and outside fishers, and created a volunteer Marine Guard that continues operating today.</p>
